 * 328. Odd Even Linked List
 * <p>
 * Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes.
 * Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
 * <p>
 * You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.
